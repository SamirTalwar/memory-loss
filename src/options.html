    <h2>Limit cookie expiry time</h2>
    <p><em>Memory Loss</em> can limit the expiry time of cookies.</p>
    <p>
      Often, servers will send cookies with instructions to keep them years or
      decades into the future. This can mean that if you visit a site, then
      visit again a year later, they can tie those visits together.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you select a limit, all cookies sent by servers with an expiry time
      greater than the limit will have their expiry time overriden to the limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you select a limit of "1 month", and then visit Your
      Favorite Social Networkâ„¢, the cookie that keeps you signed in will be
      forced to expire after 1 month, even if the social network sets the expiry
      time to years in the future.
    </p>
    <p>Choose "forever" to disable this functionality.</p>
